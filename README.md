# Bank-Account-Application-using-OOPS
Problem statement:-

read a .csv file of names, social security numbers, account type, and initial deposit
use a proper data structure to hold all these accounts
Both savings and checking accounts share the following properties:-
-> deposit()
-> withdraw()
-> transfer()
-> showInfo()

11-Digit Number( generated with the following process: 1 or 2 depending on Savings or checking,
last two digits of ssn, unique 5 - digit number, and random 3-digit number)

Savings Account holders are given a safety Deposit Box, identifies by a 3 digit number and accessed with a 4-digit code

checking Account Holders are assigned a debit Card with a 12 digit Number and a 4 digit PIN

Checking Accounts will use 15% of the base rate

The showInfo Methodshopul dreveal relevant account information as well as information specific to the checking account or savings account


LEARNING OBJECTIVE:
//End-to-end Java Application build from scratch using OO Principles amd Designs
-> robust app develipment
-> when and how t use the abstract classes
-> use an interface API to receive information
-> explore constructor and the use of super()
-> explore the read data from a file and store in a proper data structure
-> generate a random number using String API
